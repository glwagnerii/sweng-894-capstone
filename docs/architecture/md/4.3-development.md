## 4.3 Development Viewpoint Definition

### 4.3.1 Abstract
The development view focuses on the organization of the software modules and components within the test automation framework. This view describes the software architecture from the perspective of the development team, including the module structure, dependencies, and the overall build and deployment process.

### 4.3.2 Stakeholders and Their Concerns Addressed

- **Software Developers**: Understand the module structure and dependencies to guide the implementation and integration of the framework.
- **DevOps Engineers**: Ensure the build and deployment processes are efficient, reliable, and support the CI and delivery of the framework.
- **Test Engineers**: Verify the modular design supports the extensibility and maintainability of the test automation framework.
- **Configuration Managers**: Manage the versioning, branching, and merging of the test automation framework's source code and artifacts.

#### 4.3.3 Elements, Relations, and Properties
The key elements in the development view are:

- **Software Modules**: Representing the logical grouping of source code, configuration files, and other artifacts that implement a specific functionality or feature of the test automation framework.
- **Dependencies**: Representing the relationships between software modules, eg. import/export of interfaces, shared libraries, or config data.
- **Build Artifacts**: Representing the deployable units produced by the build process, like executable files, libraries, or container images.
- **Build and Deployment Processes**: Representing the automated workflows for compiling, packaging, and deploying the test automation framework.

The relationships between these elements capture the hierarchical structure of the software modules, the dependencies between them, and the flow of the build and deployment processes.  The development view will also incorporate relevant architectural styles, such as:

- **Layered**: Organizing the framework into distinct layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data access) to promote separation of concerns.
- **Aspects**: Applying aspects principles to modularize cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, error handling, configuration) across the framework.

#### 4.3.4 Language(s) to Model/Represent Conforming Views
The development view will be represented using UML component diagrams, deployment diagrams, and sequence diagrams. These diagrams will illustrate the module structure, their dependencies, the application of architectural styles, and the build and deployment processes.

#### 4.3.5 Applicable Evaluation/Analysis Techniques and Consistency/Completeness Criteria
The development view will be evaluated for:
- Modularity and Cohesion: Assessing the degree of separation of concerns and the coherence of the software modules.
- Dependency Management: Ensuring the appropriate handling of module dependencies, including version compatibility and conflict resolution.
- Build and Deployment Automation: Evaluating the efficiency, reliability, and traceability of the build and deployment processes.
- Architectural Style Adherence: Verifying the correct application of the chosen architectural styles (e.g., layered, aspect-oriented) and their benefits.
- Consistency: Verifying the alignment between the development design and the requirements, as well as with other viewpoints (e.g., logical, physical).
