| Concern | Description |
|--------|:------------|
| CRN-1  | Auditing and logging mechanisms are needed to capture model execution events, user interactions, and system-level operations for traceability, debugging, and compliance. |
| CRN-2  | Scalability must be considered to support growing numbers of AI models, concurrent inferences, and user sessions across platforms without performance degradation. |
| CRN-3  | Strong access control, authentication, and encryption are essential to protect sensitive user data, AI models, and cloud-synchronized content. |
| CRN-4  | Deployment and update processes should be streamlined across all supported platforms to ensure consistent behavior and minimize user friction. |
| CRN-5  | A modular and extensible architecture is important to support integration of new AI models, hardware acceleration backends (e.g., CUDA, Metal), and third-party plugins. |
| CRN-6  | Effective model lifecycle management is needed, including installation, versioning, validation, and removal, while preserving system integrity. |
| CRN-7  | Offline functionality must be preserved to ensure core features like model inference and data access remain available without network connectivity. |
| CRN-8  | Performance monitoring and profiling tools are necessary to evaluate inference latency, memory usage, and hardware utilization across platforms. |
| CRN-9  | Compatibility and graceful fallback between GPU acceleration (CUDA, Metal) and CPU-based inference should be ensured to support a wide range of devices. |
| CRN-10 | Clear and actionable error reporting and diagnostics are needed to help users and developers troubleshoot model execution or system failures. |
