| Concern | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CRN-1   | Auditing and logging mechanisms shall be implemented to track and record all test execution activities, results, and any modifications made to the test automation system, ensuring traceability and compliance with relevant standards and regulations.                                                   |
| CRN-2   | The test automation system shall be designed with scalability in mind, allowing it to support an increasing number of concurrent test executions and HIL systems without compromising performance or requiring significant infrastructure changes.                                                         |
| CRN-3   | Appropriate access controls, authentication, and authorization mechanisms shall be implemented to protect the intellectual property (IP) associated with the test automation system, test scripts, and any proprietary software or data involved in the testing process.                                   |
| CRN-5   | The test automation system shall provide mechanisms for easy installation, configuration, and updates, catering to scenarios where end-users or remote teams may need to deploy and maintain the system without relying on centralized IT systems or processes.                                            |
| CRN-6   | The test automation system shall be designed with a modular and extensible architecture, allowing for the addition of new testing capabilities, integration with new tools or platforms, and the incorporation of evolving testing methodologies without requiring significant changes to the core system. |
| CRN-7   | The test automation system shall support the integration of various testing tools, utilities, and libraries, enabling a comprehensive and customizable testing environment that can leverage existing resources and technologies.                                                                          |
| CRN-8   | The test automation system shall implement mechanisms for efficient test data management, including the generation, storage, and retrieval of test data, as well as the ability to handle large volumes of data generated during test execution.                                                           |
| CRN-9   | The test automation system shall provide robust reporting and visualization capabilities, allowing stakeholders to easily analyze and interpret test results, identify trends, and make informed decisions regarding the quality and readiness of the locomotive software.                                 |
