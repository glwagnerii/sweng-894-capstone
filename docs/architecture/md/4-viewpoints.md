# 4. Viewpoints
The 5+1 architectural view model provides a structured approach to describing the architecture of the test automation framework for locomotive software. This model defines five complementary viewpoints, each of which addresses the concerns of specific stakeholders and provides a different perspective on the system.

The five viewpoints are:
- **Logical Viewpoint**: Focuses on the functional requirements and the high-level design of the system.
- **Process Viewpoint**: Addresses the dynamic aspects of the system, such as concurrency, distribution, and system operations.
- **Development Viewpoint**: Concentrates on the organization of the software modules and components in the development environment.
- **Physical Viewpoint**: Deals with the deployment of the software system onto the hardware infrastructure.
- **Scenarios Viewpoint**: Illustrates the use cases and sequences of interactions that the system must support.

The following subsections provide a detailed definition for each of these viewpoints, including the stakeholders and their concerns, the key elements and relationships, and the modeling languages and analysis techniques that can be applied.

The architecture and design description will utilize appropriate diagram styles and notations to effectively communicate the various viewpoints. These may include UML diagrams, deployment diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other specialized notations as needed to capture the relevant aspects of the test automation framework.

By considering the system from these multiple viewpoints, the architecture description can capture the various concerns of the stakeholders and ensure that the test automation framework is designed to meet the overall requirements and constraints of the locomotive software project.
