## 2.1 Business Goals / Design Purpose

The architecture and design effort for the test automation framework is being undertaken as part of the evolution and enhancement of an existing system (brownfield project) to support the new Modular Control Architecture (MCA) locomotive software and associated panels and interfaces. Additionally, this effort aims to modernize the test automation framework by migrating from the legacy LabVIEW application with XML and shell scripts to a more advanced and maintainable architecture based on containers, Python, object-oriented structures, and the integration of RTI DDS messaging.

The primary objectives of this design effort are:

1. **Ensure Compatibility and Support for MCA**: Design an architecture that can effectively test and validate the new MCA locomotive control software, including its various components, panels, and interfaces, while maintaining support for legacy systems and CCA software.

2. **Modernize and Enhance the Test Automation Framework**: Transition from the existing LabVIEW-based implementation to a more modern, scalable, and extensible architecture that leverages Python, object-oriented design principles, and advanced technologies like Docker for containerized services and RTI DDS for efficient data distribution and communication.

3. **Improve Maintainability and Extensibility**: Develop an architecture that promotes modularity, separation of concerns, and adherence to industry best practices, enabling easier maintenance, future enhancements, and the integration of new testing capabilities or tools as needed.

4. **Align with Standards and Regulations**: Ensure that the architecture design complies with relevant industry standards, regulations, and guidelines including Cenelec and CATO.

5. **Enable Efficient Collaboration and Resource Allocation**: Design an architecture that facilitates the allocation of work to project teams and HIL assets, supports parallel development efforts, and enables effective collaboration among cross-functional teams involved in the testing and validation processes.

6. **Leverage New Platform for Testing**: Design the architecture to leverage new platforms that support both regression testing on Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) systems and integration testing on virtual simulators (VSIM), enabling comprehensive testing and validation of the locomotive software across different environments.
