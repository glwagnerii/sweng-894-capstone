## 2.1 Business Goals / Design Purpose

The architecture and design of ClassiCam are being developed as part of a greenfield initiative to create a cross-platform, privacy-conscious, and extensible AI-powered image classification application. ClassiCam is intended to empower users to capture, analyze, and explore visual content using domain-specific AI models, all while maintaining full control over their data and device resources.

The primary objectives of this design effort are:

1. **Enable Intelligent Visual Recognition Across Domains**
Provide users with the ability to detect and classify objects in images using customizable AI models tailored to specific domains (e.g., food, plants, documents), enabling practical and personalized use cases.

2. **Ensure Cross-Platform Accessibility and Performance**
Design a lightweight, high-performance application using Rust, Svelte, and the Tauri framework to deliver a consistent experience across iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux, while leveraging platform-specific hardware acceleration (CUDA, Metal) for optimal inference speed.

3. **Support Offline-First and Privacy-Respecting Operation**
Architect the system to function fully offline, ensuring that users can capture, classify, and manage images and models without relying on cloud services, thereby enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.

4. **Promote Extensibility Through a Plugin-Based Model System**
Enable developers and advanced users to extend the system by installing and managing custom classification models, fostering a community-driven ecosystem of reusable AI components.

5. **Facilitate Seamless Integration and Data Portability**
Allow users to export classification results in standard formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) and integrate with third-party apps and cloud storage providers (Google Drive, iCloud Drive), supporting workflows across personal and professional contexts.

6. **Deliver a User-Centric and Insightful Experience**
Provide intuitive interfaces for browsing classification history, viewing detailed object metadata, and filtering past results, helping users derive meaningful insights from their visual data over time.

7. **Maintain a Secure and Compliant Architecture**
Incorporate robust security controls, logging, and auditing features to protect user data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR.
